## 📌 Organiser:   
It is a program organised by *[Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar (IITGN)](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/)* in collaboration with *[VSD (VLSI System Design)](https://vsdiat.vlsisystemdesign.com/)*, *[SCL](https://scl.gov.in/)*, *[Synopsys](https://www.synopsys.com/)*, *[Platforms](https://www.platforms.org/)*, *[RISC-V Core Team](https://riscv.org/)*, and *[Efabless](https://github.com/efabless)* using open-source EDA community tools.

## 📌 Program Objectives
The program focuses on hands-on chip design using open-source tools like: Yosys (logic synthesis), OpenROAD/OpenLane (place & route), Magic/KLayout (layout & DRC/LVS checks), with SkyWater 130nm PDK (open-source process design kit)
The repository is created as Weekly assignment given under the umberella for RISCV-Reference SOC TapeOut program for 10 weeks.

## 🧐 Now, let's us see the individual term one by one to #🧠-💭think how the Program is being formulated and floated

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>🖥️⚙️</td>
    <td><b>RISC-V</b>: An open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), widely used in academia and industry for research and processor development.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>📦🔗</td>
    <td><b>SoC (System-on-Chip)</b>: A complete system (CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnects) integrated onto a single silicon die.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>🚀📐</td>
    <td><b>Reference SoC (Caravel)</b>: Caravel is a baseline RISC-V SoC design that participants use as a template for customization, learning, and final tapeout. It allows developers to integrate their custom IP (Intellectual Property) into the platform and test its functionality using an open-source toolchain. Caravel is used with Efabless's Open MPW (Multi-Project Wafer) and chipIgnite shuttles, and it's built on the Sky130 technology node from SkyWater Technologies.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>🔲🧩</td>
    <td><b>Tapeout</b>: The final step of the IC design flow, where the design is signed off and sent to fabrication.</td>
  </tr>

👉 Essentially, it’s a real-world tapeout training program for students to learn chip design and actually fabricate a working RISC-V chip. 
VLSI is not just a buzzword but a career that demands patience, depth, and constant learning. With India emerging as a global hub for chip design and the market booming, it’s the right time for aspirants to focus on core skills like RTL, Verification, PD, DFT, AMS, and scripting

## 📌 📋 Task Progress
## 📅 Week 0 — Setup & Tools


| Task    | Description | Status   | Help Material | Submission Date |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Task 0  | 🛠️ Tools Installation — Installed **Iverilog**, **Yosys**, and **GTKWave** | ✅ Done | [Link / Notes]() |20th september 2025|

## 🌟 Key Learnings from Week 0

Here’s what I achieved in the first week of the **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program**:

- 🛠️ **Tools Installed & Verified:** Successfully installed **Iverilog**, **Yosys**, and **GTKWave**, and verified their functionality.  
- 💻 **Environment Setup:** Learned how to set up the **basic RTL design and synthesis environment** for future experiments.  
- 🏗️ **System Prepared:** Configured the system and prepared it for the upcoming **RTL → GDSII flow** experiments.
