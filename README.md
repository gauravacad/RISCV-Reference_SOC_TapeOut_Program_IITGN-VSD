## 📌 Organiser: IIT Gandhinagar (IITGN) + VSD + SCL + Synopsys + Platforms + RISV core and Efabless 
It is an program organised by *Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar* in collaboration with *VSD (VLSI System Design)* and *Efabless* with open-source EDA community tools.
---

## 📌 Program Objectives
The program focuses on hands-on chip design using open-source tools like: Yosys (logic synthesis), OpenROAD/OpenLane (place & route), Magic/KLayout (layout & DRC/LVS checks), with SkyWater 130nm PDK (open-source process design kit)
The repository is created as Weekly assignment given under the umberella for RISCV-Reference SOC TapeOut program for 10 weeks.

## 🧐 Now, let's us see the individual term one by one to #🧠-💭think how the Program is being formulated and floated
<p align="justify">

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>🖥️⚙️</td>
    <td><b>RISC-V</b>: An open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), widely used in academia and industry for research and processor development.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>📦🔗</td>
    <td><b>SoC (System-on-Chip)</b>: A complete system (CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnects) integrated onto a single silicon die.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>🚀📐</td>
    <td><b>Reference SoC (Caravel)</b>: Caravel is a baseline RISC-V SoC design that participants use as a template for customization, learning, and final tapeout. It allows developers to integrate their custom IP (Intellectual Property) into the platform and test its functionality using an open-source toolchain. Caravel is used with Efabless's Open MPW (Multi-Project Wafer) and chipIgnite shuttles, and it's built on the Sky130 technology node from SkyWater Technologies.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>🔲🧩</td>
    <td><b>Tapeout</b>: The final step of the IC design flow, where the design is signed off and sent to fabrication.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

</p>
👉 Essentially, it’s a real-world tapeout training program for students to learn chip design and actually fabricate a working RISC-V chip.
