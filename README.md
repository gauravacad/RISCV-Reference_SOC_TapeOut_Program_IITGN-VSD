# RISCV-Reference_SOC_TapeOut_Program_IITGN-VSD 
It is an program organised by Indian Institute of Technology, Gandhinagar in collaboration with VSD (VLSI System Design) and Efabless with open-source EDA community tools.
The program focuses on hands-on chip design using open-source tools like: Yosys (logic synthesis), OpenROAD/OpenLane (place & route), Magic/KLayout (layout & DRC/LVS checks), with SkyWater 130nm PDK (open-source process design kit)
The repository is created as Weekly assignment given under the umberella  for RISCV-Reference_SOC_TapeOut_Program_IITGN-VSD for next 10 weeks. 
Now, let's us see the individual term from which the naming is done. 
The first term is RISC-V, It is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA), widely used in academia and industry for research and processor development. 
The SoC (System-on-Chip) is a complete system (CPU, memory, peripherals, interconnects) integrated onto a single silicon die. 
Reference SoC (Caravel): Caravel is an baseline RISC-V SoC design that participants use as a template for customization, learning, and final tapeout.  It allows developers to integrate their custom IP (Intellectual Property) into the platform and test its functionality using an open-source toolchain. Caravel is used with Efabless's Open MPW (Multi-Project Wafer) and chipIgnite shuttles, and it's built on the Sky130 technology node from SkyWater Technologies. 
Tapeout: It is the final step of the IC design flow, where the design is signed off and sent to fabrication.
