## What type of machine we need to prepare it for Week - 0 Task ?
Dear Friend we need a Computer machine either Installed with Windows 10/11 or Linux - Ubuntu / Centos or Mac. If we dont have Linux machine then we need a üéØ Virtual Machine Configuration for which Instruction Pdf is provided. 
Here the link is given to download Oracle virtual machine (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) Just download with the given link and install like normal software you usually do with double click on the executable.

Click on "Windows Host" and a file named VirtualBox-7.2.2-170484-Win.exe get downloaded on your system.

## What is VirtualBox? What is its Role in Tool Installation.
VirtualBox is a free and open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle. It allows you to run multiple operating systems (OS) on your computer at the same time ‚Äî like running Linux inside Windows or macOS. Here your main computer‚Äôs e.g., Windows, macOS becomes Host and VirtualBox becomes application on top to execute the our Guest OS i.e. Ubuntu Linux. There we will install the Opensource tools like (Yosys, OpenLane, Magic, etc.). 

## How to install the Ubuntu 20.04 on this VirtualBox.
Before this make sure that VirtualBox is already installed in your windows machine. Now for Ubuntu 20.04+ please visit the link (https://ubuntu.com/download). Move to Desktop Ubuntu for download.


<img width="1614" height="664" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93e36ff4-2f14-4e4c-b9c6-91771a2c1972" />

In this Picture the Blue tick shows the forward path you need to click upon for Ubuntu ISO image download on your computer. On click you will land to the page showing the Intel or AMD 64-bit architecture dont choose ARM one (in general it is not for us).

<img width="1006" height="273" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89f1aed6-784a-4ce4-a2fc-5766d2afb3a1" />

The file size is 5.9 GB will take some time, so, have patience. 

## What is Iso image? 
Most Linux distros (like Ubuntu, Fedora) are distributed as ISO files. An ISO image is a single file that contains the complete contents of a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray disc.
It‚Äôs basically a digital copy (archive) of the entire disc, including
-  üëâ Operating system files
-  üëâ Bootable data (so you can install OS)
-  üëâ File system structure

## Now we will give steps to install the this Ubuntu.ISO image with Virtualbox.
Please check this 3 minute video for installation of ubuntu only. Choose your OS machine to Win 10/ 11 in the first section. Dont worry if not known to you. Just move with video.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tool Installation & Verification 
- üëâ Now inside the VirtualBox you will have Ubuntu. Here right click and open an terminal. IF you dont find see the image below

  
 <img width="1033" height="565" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/918a1a17-9757-4b73-b558-128c684036ac" />
- Now the terminal will open and you can see the <code style="color : blue">username@hostname</code> so our username is  "vsdgp" and Hostname is "VSD". This is exactly what we have done in VirtualBox setting as
  shown below

  <img width="937" height="479" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49bc4889-74f7-4891-b6b6-5abdf4560980" />

- Now, do "ls" to list the directory in terminal and "cd" to change the directory. These are two basic commands.

<img width="936" height="477" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a0e5182-097f-41b7-959f-c589578f5f65" />

- First Just call the <code style="color : blue">git --version</code> command in the terminal. It should return if you have the Git tool for downloading the repos. Let's try.
  
<img width="943" height="478" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e28315a-35b4-4a25-aec1-86ab5b7de56c" />

The picture clearly shows that the git need to be installed, it also gives us the Hint that use "sudo apt install git" is the command.


<img width="936" height="470" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/517f7259-44c7-4e6e-bb2c-488ef3a9053e" />

- Once it is done, it will ask your password , Then it will ask "Y/y" Yes for the changes in the system and as download is complete it will show some version on checking it again

<img width="934" height="476" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb20bdd1-c56e-4afa-bbb4-7cb45b6f9f67" />

- Friends, you have completed the major step of Installation, Now for ‚úÖ Yosys Installation we need create a "vsdflow" folder using mkdir command. Then change the current directory to vsdflow using cd command and clone the repository ($ git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git) and the dependencies as  - shown in the VSD Pdf.

<img width="939" height="481" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/232676a1-fcd8-446f-8974-0ea2e6cf70fc" />

- Now clone the Yosys,  "git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git"

<img width="1267" height="365" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23575dff-886a-4304-bcc9-a75ea72fb3ba" />

- Yosys is downlaoded but still need installation. "ls" will list the folder we downloaded with git command.

<img width="1395" height="852" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa24b7fa-8a9a-4601-8e19-44a62ebf20ba" />

- Now change directory to yosys to install. But we need to use "make" command to install. Hence first "make" needs to be installed.

<img width="1308" height="442" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/83c3c6b7-2e01-4c55-aed5-d8917422d674" />

- copy and paste below commands on terminal as shown and press "y" When and whereever asked. It will take some time depending on Internet speed.
  
<img width="643" height="140" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21764ad1-f03a-455e-942f-21879ddd036f" />

## üé® Magic VLSI ‚Äì Layout Tool
- Purpose: Magic VLSI Layout Tool performs design and layout editing. Developed at UC Berkeley (John Ousterhout, the same person behind Tcl/Tk)
- Still actively used in academic and open-source ASIC flows (e.g., with SkyWater SKY130 PDK).
- Key enabler in the Open Source Silicon ecosystem (Google + Efabless shuttle programs).

 ## ‚úÖ Magic VLSI Installation
 ```bash
# The code is one line with assume auto Yes for all the packages.
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y m4 tcsh csh libx11-dev tcl-dev tk-dev \
    libcairo2-dev mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libncurses-dev
$ cd vsdflow

# Clone Magic repository
$ git clone https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/magic
$ cd magic

# Configure build
$ ./configure

# Build Magic
$ make

# Install system-wide
$ sudo make install

# test the installation
$ which magic
$ magic

```

<img width="824" height="504" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73672b27-996d-4e32-87cf-9e62f3524e7d" />

- Running ./congifure will output like this condition no error in any step before

<img width="779" height="513" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de350132-9f5d-4f66-a850-d4305fbb88e9" />

- Now sysem wide install some people may get output error. Even after doing properly you may get some error or system lands to ‚ùå Error. One of the error I have for e.g.
   
<img width="762" height="510" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef881c1f-1f5f-4798-a65a-ba23b5661e78" />

- Now Solution is for the error is like performing the same steps with care.

 ```bash

# move to same folder and clean the build
$ cd ~/magic    # or where you cloned Magic
# clean Build Magic
$ make clean

# Check the dependencies again 
$ sudo apt-get install -y tcl-dev tk-dev tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev \
    libx11-dev libcairo2-dev mesa-common-dev libglu1-mesa-dev \
    libncurses-dev

# configure, Build and Install again 
$ ./configure --with-tcl --with-tk --with-x
$ sudo make
$ sudo make install

# test the installation
$ which magic
$ magic
```
