## What is VirtualBox? What is its Role in Tool Installation.
VirtualBox is a free and open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle. It allows you to run multiple operating systems (OS) on your computer at the same time — like running Linux inside Windows or macOS, without needing to restart your machine. Here your main computer’s e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux becomes a Host and VirtualBox becomes middle man where the Guest OS i.e. Ubuntu get runs. On top of this we will install the Opensource tools (Yosys, OpenLane, Magic, etc.).
